        <h2>Project Description:</h2>
        <p>Our project is based on the Freeze Tag Problem (FTP), which is an optimization problem given a swarm of robots that involves using an initial “awake” robot to wake the remaining set of “asleep” robots in the shortest possible time. We would like to expand upon this problem by not just implementing it in an empty plane, but by adding obstacles to the space as well as terrain that might slow movement. The idea is to simulate the problem in a more realistic space. The main adjustments would be implementing new data structures to represent the space and using a search algorithm instead of Euclidean distance.</p>

        <p>We plan on implementing standard algorithms like greedy static and dynamic and random selection. We would like to implement the convex hull solution but that would likely require reworking due to the obstacles in our space; we will see if we can actually implement it effectively. We have read about another algorithm that uses clustering to supplement a divide and conquer method so we would like to look into implementing that as well.</p>

        <p>Another potential idea we have would be to implement a field of view for each robot, either as a cone or a circle, that would only allow a robot to see other robots within the field of view. Therefore, a robot without another robot in the field of view would need to search the space until it could find a robot it can see.</p>
    
        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>The Freeze Tag Problem, or robot swarm problem as it is also called, is an open research optimization problem. It can be modeled in several scenarios, including swarm robotics and data transfer within a network, where the ultimate goal is to efficiently determine an optimal schedule to awaken all robots or transfer data to all nodes in a network. There has been much research to show that the problem to find an optimal awakening schedule is NP-Hard in euclidean space. While this stands, it has also been proven that O(log n) approximations exist. There are plenty of algorithm types that have been utilized to determine the problem solution, including classic greedy algorithms, local search algorithms, and clustering algorithms.</p>

        <h2>A* Search Algorithm</h2>
        <p>A* is a space and graph traversal algorithm which is prominently used due to its optimality and efficiency. For finding the shortest path, A* improves upon algorithms like breadth first search by utilizing a heuristic to prioritize paths that have the shortest potential cost. Specifically it attempts to minimize f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) is the calculated distance from the source and h(n) is the heuristic based estimation of the distance to the sink. In the worst case, a* runs in O(bd) time where b is the branching factor and d is the solution depth, though good heuristics allow many nodes to be pruned, reducing the solution scale.</p>
        <p>In our obstacle expansion of the FTP, A* is an effective solution for determining the distance between robots efficiently. Since we are operating in 2D euclidean space, we can simply use the manhattan distance for our heuristic h(n). Since this heuristic also reflects how our robots physically move in space, this is guaranteed to be the optimal distance to the target robot, given there are no obstacles in the way. Whenever we are required to find the distance between robots, we utilize the A* algorithm.</p>
        
        <h2>Ftp Algorithms Implemented</h2>
        <h3>Greedy Static</h3>

        <p>This is perhaps the most simple effective algorithm we implemented. Each awake robot will be assigned to the closest asleep robot that has not been targeted by an awake robot. Once all asleep robots have been targeted by awake robots, newly awoken robots may target any closest asleep robot. Since target robots are not changed after they are assigned, this algorithm is considered static. Greedy static will serve as a baseline for the other algorithms.</p>

        <h3>Greedy Dynamic</h3>

        <p>Greedy dynamic is similar to the greedy static approach, except that it provides a means for dynamic reallocation of targets. Awake robots will continue to target the closest untargeted robot when possible. Whenever a new robot is awoken, the algorithm will iterate over the asleep robots to determine the closest awake robot to each. Based on this, targets of awake robots will be updated to ensure that each asleep robot is targeted by the closed awake robot to it. This provides benefits in the scenario where a newly awakened robot is closer to a targeted asleep robot than the one it is targeted by. In the worst case, the optimal schedule found will be no worse than greedy static’s solution since no dynamic reassignments will occur so only the static assignment will be applied.</p>

        <h3>Cluster-based</h3>

        <p>We observed during initial testing that algorithms had often performed worse when outliers were introduced in the set of points. These points often lie on the edge of the board and are targeted last due to their distance from the rest of the robots. It was clear that enabling these outliers to be targeted earlier and more frequently could improve the solution by reducing the distance traveled towards the end of the runtime, which is why we decided to implement a cluster based algorithm.</p>

        <p>For this solution, we preprocess the asleep robots by grouping those with close proximity to each other into clusters. Then we employ an algorithm similar to greedy static with priority on these clusters. When an awake robot targets an asleep robot, it also claims the cluster that the asleep robot is in as a target. The awake robot is responsible for waking all asleep robots in a cluster, and no other awake robot can target asleep robots in this cluster (unless all clusters are claimed, where the algorithm reduces to the greedy static). This ensures that targeting all clusters is prioritized, thus outliers will have awake robots sent to them earlier. </p>

        <p>The clustering algorithm chosen is DBScan, which is a popular density based algorithm, chosen because we only care about clustering points that are neighboring each other. The algorithm takes two hyperparameters: eps and minPoints. The former is the maximum distance where two points may be considered neighbors and the latter refers to the minimum number of neighbors required for a point to be considered a core point. The algorithm begins by classifying each point as either a core, border, or noise point. Core points have at least minPoints neighbors within eps range. All other points are considered noise or border points, where border points are neighbors of core points and noise points are not. Finally, clusters are generated recursively from all core points and their neighbors. The efficiency and effectiveness of this algorithm is dependent on the hyperparameters and the dataset. In the worst case, the algorithm will generate one cluster with n points or n clusters with 1 point, running in O(n2) time, whereas the best case will perform this clustering efficiently in O(nlogn) time.</p>
